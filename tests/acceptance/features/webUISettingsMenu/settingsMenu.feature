@webUI
Feature: add users
	As an admin
	I want to be able to change different settings
	So that I can see various details about users

	Background:
		Given these users have been created but not initialized:
			| username | password | displayname | email         |
			| user1    | 1234     | User One    | u1@oc.com.np  |
			| user2    | 1234     | User Two    | u2@oc.com.np  |
		And user admin has logged in using the webUI
		And the administrator has browsed to the users page

	Scenario: administrator should be able to see email of a user
		When the administrator enables the setting "Show email address" using the webUI
		Then the administrator should be able to see email of the users as:
			| username | email        |
			| user1    | u1@oc.com.np |
			| user2    | u2@oc.com.np |
