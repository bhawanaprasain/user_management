@webUI
Feature: add users
  As an admin
  I want to be able to change different settings
  So that I can see various details about users

  Background: 
    Given these users have been created but not initialized:
      | username | password | displayname | email        |
      | user1    | %regular%     | User One    | u1@oc.com.np |
      | user2    | %regular%     | User Two    | u2@oc.com.np |
    And user admin has logged in using the webUI
    And the administrator has browsed to the users page

  Scenario: administrator should be able to see email of a user
    When the administrator enables the setting "Show email address" using the webUI
    Then the administrator should be able to see email of the users as:
      | username | email        |
      | user1    | u1@oc.com.np |
      | user2    | u2@oc.com.np |

  Scenario: administrator should be able to see storage location of a user
    When the administrator enables the setting "Show storage location" using the webUI
    Then the administrator should be able to see storage location of the users as:
      | username  | storage location                  |
      | user1     | /data/user1 |
      | user2     | /data/user2 |
